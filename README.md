## baseball-parity-project

In this project, I take a look at Major League Baseball's parity in the divisional era (1995-2021) by visualizing the standard deviation of team wins on each day of the regular season for each year. 

 In this repo, you will find:

 - Methodology.ipynb - a Markdown file explaining the steps of the project and how I went about creating the visualizations
 - Baseball Parity Calendar-Creating a DataFrame with Wins.ipynb - a python file where I did all my scraping and analysis
 - df_wins_stds.csv - a csv file of the dataframe for my first visualization
 - melted_df.csv - a csv file of the result of melting the first df into a different data structure compatible with Flourish's heatmap tool
 - df_eos_wins_stds.csv - a csv file of the dataframe for my second visualization
 - Major League Baseball's Parity Problem _ Flourish.html - my first visualization, showing the standard deviation in wins for every day of every year 1995-2021
 - MLB on pace for another season of disparate results _ Created with Datawrapper.html - my second visualization, showing the actual end-of-season standard deviations values and those values adjusted for season length
